Trying different ML models in order to find which one better classify if a comment is toxic or not.

The main stages of it consisted of Data Load, Visualization of the different comment categories, Lemmatization, trying different algorithms: Logistic Regression, Multilayer perceptron, Embeddings, CNN and a WordCloud representation.
Finally, there is a conclusion comparing the different results (accuracy and time) and an example with the best model.
